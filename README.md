# theShoppies

The Goal of this project is to utilize some interesting React libraries.
I'd be experimenting with:

1. React Query to fetch the API and deal with Caching
2. ContextAPI for state Management
3. Pagination for Api Result
4. Testing for React Apps

The site is built with:

1. `React`
2. `CSS`

## How to use the app
1. Search for a Particular Movie
2. Nominate the movie for your top 5
3. Remove any movie from your nomination when you want.

### To-do
I need to revamp the styling to make it pretty with colors. I will get back to it before the end of this week.

In the meantime, I'd be busting some Heroku Errors.
